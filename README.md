# SQL_Project_EPL
In this example, I have written a query to create 2 separate tables about the 20 football teams that played in the English Premier League in the 22/23 season and the top 50 goalscorers in that season. I have then answered some questions about the data using common SQL commands to filter the data appropriately.
